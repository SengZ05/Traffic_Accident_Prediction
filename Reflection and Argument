This project demonstrated that combining classical ML models with proper preprocessing and data balancing techniques significantly improves prediction accuracy in traffic accident severity classification.

Random Forest performed best due to its ensemble nature and ability to handle feature interactions.

Logistic Regression offered quick baseline results with interpretability but lower accuracy.

SVM provided competitive performance, particularly in capturing complex decision boundaries.

The use of SMOTE effectively mitigated class imbalance, which is crucial in accident datasets with skewed severity distributions.

Future work will explore more complex ensemble models and neural networks, integrate additional features such as weather and road conditions, and deploy interactive dashboards for real-time accident risk assessment.
