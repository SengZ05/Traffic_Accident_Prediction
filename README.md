## 🌍 Societal Impact

Road traffic accidents are a critical issue across the globe, resulting in thousands of injuries and fatalities every day. Despite the urgency of the problem, there's a lack of accessible, data-driven analysis available to understand and prevent these accidents.

This project leverages machine learning to analyze patterns in road traffic accidents. The insights gained aim to assist **citizens, researchers, and policymakers** in reducing accident occurrences and enhancing road safety through intelligent, data-informed decisions.

## ❓ Problem Statement

- Traffic accidents remain one of the leading causes of preventable deaths.
- There is insufficient public access to clean, visual, and predictive accident data.
- This project seeks to fill that gap using real-world datasets and ML.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

- **What** are the most common causes of road traffic accidents?
- **What** levels of traffic density, speed limits, number of vehicles, or driver characteristics (age and experience) are most associated with traffic accidents?
- **Why** do certain traffic conditions or driver profiles lead to higher accident occurrences?
- **Why** are certain driver age groups or experience levels more prone to accidents?
- **How** can we clean and optimize raw accident data for high-quality analysis?
- **How** can machine learning be used to predict the likelihood of accidents based on traffic and driver-related features?
