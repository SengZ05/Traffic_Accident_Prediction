## 🌍 Societal Impact

Road traffic accidents are a critical global issue, causing thousands of injuries and fatalities daily. Despite the urgency, accessible, data-driven insights into factors contributing to accidents remain limited.

This project applies machine learning to analyze key traffic and driver features such as traffic density, speed limits, number of vehicles, driver age, and experience. The goal is to provide actionable insights for **citizens, researchers, and policymakers** to reduce accident risks and improve road safety.

## ❓ Problem Statement

- Traffic accidents continue to be a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide.
- There is a lack of clear analysis linking specific traffic conditions and driver characteristics to accident occurrences.
- This project aims to address this gap using a real-world dataset with relevant traffic and driver features.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

- **What** traffic and driver factors (traffic density, speed limits, number of vehicles, driver age, and experience) most strongly correlate with accidents?  
- **Why** do certain traffic conditions or driver profiles increase accident likelihood?  
- **Why** are specific driver age groups or experience levels more prone to causing accidents?  
- **How** can we clean and preprocess raw traffic data to improve analysis quality?  
- **How** can machine learning be applied to predict the likelihood of accidents based on these traffic and driver-related features?

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Transforming raw traffic and driver data into a clean, usable format  
- 📊 **Visualization**: Creating insightful charts to reveal accident patterns based on traffic density, speed limits, driver age, and experience  
- 🔮 **Predictive Modeling**: Building ML models to forecast accident risk based on traffic and driver attributes   
- 🌐 **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combining multiple features to understand their combined impact on accidents  
- 💡 **Open Source**: Project and code will be publicly available after completion
