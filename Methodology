ML Model Selection
For this traffic accident prediction project, three machine learning models were selected to evaluate and compare their effectiveness:

Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble model that handles non-linear data and interaction between features well. It is resistant to overfitting and works well with imbalanced datasets when combined with class weighting.

Logistic Regression: A baseline linear model that provides probabilistic outputs and interpretability of feature impacts.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for its strong performance on classification tasks, especially with non-linear kernels such as RBF.

These models provide a mix of simplicity, interpretability, and power to capture complex patterns in the dataset.
