The dataset was downloaded using Kagglehub.

Data cleaning included handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Categorical features were normalized.

Data was split, scaled, and balanced before model training.

Models were trained, evaluated, and visualized (confusion matrices, ROC curves).

Prediction function created for easy future use.

The cleaned dataset and model outputs (confusion matrix images, ROC curves) are saved for submission.

Code is well-commented and organized for reproducibility.
